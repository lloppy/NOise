# API NOise


##Map of noise pollution


We created this project at the Sirius Educational Center.



### Problem:
Ambient noise affects people's health and well-being. Damage to the nervous system, high blood pressure, fatigue, reduced attention span, and hearing loss are all consequences of noise pollution.

### Our Goal: 
The essence of the project is to create an auxiliary map (layer) with the marks of noise pollution, which will show the number of dB (noise level) in a particular place.


### Objectives: 
- Reading the user's geolocation
- Connecting to the FireBase database (sending and receiving geotags)
- Automatic point data update
- Noise information, protection tips
- +web version (django)

Our map will be used by large real estate companies (such as CIAN, DOMKLIK, Etazhi, YandexNedvizhimost, Avito, Yula). 
API can be built into services.
